          <h2> Making of this website </h2>
          <p>So, I'm writing this post while I am creating this website, therefore some of the things I mention may be gone by the time I finalize my design (Or maybe not! Maybe I planned properly!). Either way, this is just going to be a summary of the things I did.</p>
          <p>One weird issue I faced had to do with autofilling of the contact form. When the browser autofills, it applies a style called <strong>input:-internal-autofill-selected</strong>. More specifically, it looks like this: </p>
          <pre>
          <code>
input:-internal-autofill-selected {
  appearance: menulist-button;
  background-image: none !important;
  background-color: -internal-light-dark(rgb(232, 240, 254), rgba(70, 90, 126, 0.4)) !important;
  color: fieldtext !important;
}
          </code>
          </pre>
          <p>It makes the input field change color from the normal dark gray background and light gray text to black text with white background. (If you're wondering what I mean with dark gray background and light gray text, then you're probably on light mode. I probably should've mentioned that I work mostly on dark mode.)</p>
          <img src="./assets/media/autofill_example.webp" alt="autofill_example">
          <p>Now, while it is perhaps helpful in that it indicates how the browser stores the autofill data in itself, the form I have doesn't have any particularly sensitive information (debatably the email address), I think I prefer not suddenly blinding users.</p>
          <p>One thing to note is that these stylings use the !important tag, which indicates that they shouldn't be overwritten by other CSS. In order to get around that (kinda hacky, not great), I instead chose to use the following: </p>
<pre>
            <code>
              input:-webkit-autofill,
              input:-webkit-autofill:focus {
                &nbsp;&nbsp;transition: background-color 600000s 0s, color 600000s 0s;
              }
            </code>
</pre>
          <p>Basically, what it does is force the background color change from dark to light occur over 600000s, or 1000 minutes, which, realistically, should never finish. </p>

          <h2> Rithmatics </h2>
          <p>  
          One of my favorite books is <i>The Rithmatist</i>, by Brandon Sanderson. 
          In particular, the system of Rithmatics is fascinating to me.
          Rithmatics is a magic system that uses chalk. 
          Drawing different things has different effects, some of which are detailed below.

          <p> One particular interest is how exactly aesthetic beauty, which determines the strength of chalklings, is determined. Is there actually some form of objective measure, as assumed by the characters in the story?</p>
          <p>While it's true that some things are clearly less well drawn than others (see: my poor attempt at an icon (if you're reading this, it's coming soon&trade;)), I think there exists a point at which objectivity bleeds into subjectivity.</p>
          <p>For example, the Mona Lisa is considered one of the best painintgs in the modern world&mdash;if it were converted to a chalkling (somehow), how strong would that be? Could we create a scale from my poor attempt at drawing a logo to the Mona List in terms of chalkling strength? Food for thought.</p>
